## Objective

A 24/7/365 internet connection between Earth and Mars would be cool. Assuming an existing bidirectional Starlink constellation around both Earth and Mars, a heliocentric constellation could enable a permanent link between the two planets and lay the groundwork for a solar-system-wide network. This repository contains the source code for a simulation and 3D render of such a constellation. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive visualization of this problem. I am also submitting this as my final project for CS577.
